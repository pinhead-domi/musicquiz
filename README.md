## Road to V0.1
Until the first major release, I have compiled a list of changes that I consider necessary for that:

 - [ ] Removal of most unwrap statements in server and client code
 - [ ] Robust logging mechanism
 - [ ] Server configuration using some appropriate file format
 - [ ] Save grading history of a client to file
 - [ ] General bug detection and removal
